## Description

![phonememaker_ui](media/phonememaker_ui.png)

This adds a floating Phoneme Maker panel to the left of the context menu, which allows one to make own preset groups for the Phoneme Tool

### Features

- **Presets**: Load preset groups from the Phoneme Tool
- **Preview**: Preview each phoneme/viseme/emotion entry
- **Filter**: Ignore certain flexes when making visemes or emotions

### Rational

The Phoneme Tool does not come with its own phoneme/viseme/emotion generator for GMod; these can only be generated through Source Filmmaker, and by extension through Valve's Faceposer application. This addon reduces reliance on old programs to make phoneme presets; it allows the user to directly make them in GMod.

## Disclaimer

**This tool has been tested in singleplayer.** Although this tool may function in multiplayer, please expect bugs and report any that you observe in the issue tracker.
